Urban GreenScape is a creative initiative that transforms underutilized city rooftops into flourishing community gardens. These green spaces address major urban challenges such as environmental degradation, limited greenery, and food insecurity. By merging sustainable ecological design with active community participation, the project strengthens urban resilience and promotes eco-conscious living. The rooftop gardens serve as shared areas for growing fresh produce, fostering social connection, and encouraging hands-on learning about sustainability. Urban GreenScape offers a practical and scalable model for reimagining city spaces, inspiring healthier communities and greener futures.
